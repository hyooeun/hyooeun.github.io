    As in other domains, artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important in medicine. In particular, deep learning-based pattern recognition methods can advance the field of pathology by incorporating clinical, radiologic, and genomic data to accurately diagnose diseases and predict patient prognoses. In this review, we present an overview of artificial intelligence, the brief history of artificial intelligence in the medical domain, recent advances in artificial intelligence applied to pathology, and future prospects of pathology driven by artificial intelligence.

#     Automatic diagnosis of breast cancer is a challenge that promises more accessible healthcare. In this paper, we describe the process of predicting slide-level cancer metastasis
#     with machine learning techniques. First, a whole slide image
#     is split into smaller patches which are classified in pixel-level
#     based on Deeplab v3+. Pixel-level classifiers are trained
#     under auto hardmining process. Next, based on pixel-level
#     results for whole slide images, slide-level heatmaps are generated and classified by rule-based criteria for negative, itc,
#     micro and macro. Finally patient-level pN stages are determined by each individual slide-level predictions.
